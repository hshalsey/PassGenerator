# PasswordGenerator

This password generator allows a user to choose how long they would like their password, if they would like special characters, numbers or uppercase letters, along with the auto generated lowercase letters. It then generates a random password that follows the parameters the user sets. It does this by giving users prompts to confirm what they want and then the final product is generated to the screen.
